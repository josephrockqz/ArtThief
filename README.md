# Art Thief of the Patrons' Show

## What's going on?

Art Thief helps you review and manage the hundreds of artworks available at the Art League's Patrons' Show in Alexandria, VA. Plus it makes the event and the planning more fun. With Art Thief, you'll be able to download this year's artwork, rate it, and put it into a list based on your personal preference. During the show, Art Thief makes it easy to quickly track which artworks have been chosen so that you're ready to make a selection when your name is called.

Held annually on President's day weekend more than 40 years, the Patrons' Show is a fabulous event in which hundreds of artists donate their work and hundreds of patrons go home with beautiful artworks. The money raised goes to support a great institution. Of course with hundreds of artworks, creating and managing a long list of those that interest you requires a lot of effort - not to mention the scramble to keep your list up to date during the show. Art Thief is here to help and it's free.

Art Thief was created because an extraordinary event deserves extraordinary technology.
